# Lua Support for Xcode 4+ #
1. Clone this repository
2. Open Add-Lua.sh and change the DVTFOUNDATION_PATH if necessary.  You probably do not need to change this if you are on Xcode 4.3+
3. Make sure Xcode is closed
4. Run Add-Lua.sh from the terminal with sudo (I.E. 'sudo Add-Lua.sh')
5. Enter your admin password and hit enter
6. Lua should now be correctly highlighted in Xcode


Special thanks to [araxara](https://github.com/araxara) for the Objective-J version of this code.
